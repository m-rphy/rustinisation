# rustinisation
This is a repo that catalogs me becoming a Rustacean

## *Beginner*
This directory includes the basic types of Rust, the concepts of ownership
and barrowing, as-well-as how to oranize data with stucts/enums and add functionality
the composite data with impl blocks.

In addition to the core concepts of the Rust language, I have included examples of 
how to implement librabry crates and binary crates within a package. 

Lastly, no software is complete without being thoroughly tested, so I have included
examplse of how implement unit tests and integration tests in your Rust packages.

## *Intermediate*

This is just beginning, but I am starting with generics. I will then move onto traits,
including supertraits, trait bounds, trait objects, deriving traits, and The Orphan Rule.

## *Advanced*

It's a ways away as of now, by we'll focus on async and unsafe Rust!
