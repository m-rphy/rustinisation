    A Computer Resources
------------------------------
Computation -> CPU
- crunch numbers

Memory -> persistane & volatile memory
- store data

persistant -> hard-drive 
 - aka "secondary mem" 
 - slow
 - abundant
 - can hold data without power


volative -> RAM 
- aka working mem 
- fast (orders of magnitude faster)
- scarce (orders of magnitude less)
- used during program execution
- cannot persist w/o power

They work together!!

SQL db - persistent mem
Server running -> RAM

we need to manage the way our programs
use RAM!



                  - Function Args, local variables
                  - Stack Frame for each fn call
     STACK        - Lifetime of function
       |          - Known at compile time               
       V          - Cleaned after return
                  - Dynamic/ Fixed upper limit
    
    _________ <- Stack over flow


   Free Memory  


                  - Values that live beyond fn lifetime 
       ^          - Lifetime define by Programmer
       |          - Values accessed by mulitple threads 
                  - Manual cleanup
     HEAP         - Large values
                  - Unknown size at compile time 
                    (Dynamic Size)
    
    
    STATIC        - Programs Binary Instructions
                  - Static Variables & stirng literals
                  - Size is fixed known at compile time
                  - Lifetime of program
                  - cleaned up after program is finished executing


 When we talk about memory management, we are really talking
 about managing memory on the heap!
